3GC3 Final Project

3D Pong Game

Inspired by "curveball" game but with a twist, CPU is hidden by fog for interesting gameplay.

Arrow keys to control, s to start new game, spacebar to launch ball to begin play, esc to exit.

IMPORTANT:
If your system does not have openGL and freeglut installed, simply place the dll files in the bin.zip file into the 'PongGame' folder
